# Wordle-but-worse-also-a-wordle-helper-that-sucks-

This is wordle, but text based in a command line using python (which you need to run this) that I made to avoid studying for a circuits exam. It also has a wordle helper which tells you all of the possible answers, but it gives literally any 5 letter word, not just the ones in the wordle dictionary. The code also sucks, so good luck trying to read it.
